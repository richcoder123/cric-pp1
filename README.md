# CricPp1

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.3.

It is a personal project created to showcase few important angular concepts - generic components, services, lazy loading, filtering, ng-template, ng-container, routing etc.
I have written raw code and styles and haven't used any third party apps.
The app also showcases responsive design.
Card, detail card, chip, using chips as filters and clickable navigation items are the major features w.r.t. design.
Since, it's just for demo purpose, the code quality and UX design is pretty average - I write better code on enterprise apps.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
